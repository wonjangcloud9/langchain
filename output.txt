{'input': "If wiki doesn't have any information, give it to me at DuckDuckGo.Research about the XZ backdoor", 'output': 'On March 29, 2024, a backdoor was discovered in the Linux utility xz, specifically within the liblzma library, in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 that were released in February 2024. The software developer Andres Freund reported this issue. The xz utility is commonly present in most Linux distributions, but the backdoor specifically targeted Debian- and RPM-based systems running on the x86-64 architecture. At the time of discovery, the backdoored version had not been widely deployed to production systems but was present in development versions of major distributions.\n\nThe backdoor allowed an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code on the affected Linux system. This vulnerability was considered critical and was assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, which is the highest possible score, indicating a severe level of threat.\n\nXZ Utils, which includes the xz program, is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. It uses the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) for compression and decompression.\n\nIn computing, a backdoor is a method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer or system, often covertly. Backdoors can be used for securing remote access to a computer or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. They can take various forms, such as hidden parts of a program, separate programs, code in firmware, or parts of an operating system. Backdoors can be used maliciously to gain access to privileged information, corrupt or delete data, or transfer information within networks. They can also be installed deliberately for legitimate purposes, such as allowing manufacturers to restore user passwords. However, if not properly secured, they can be exploited by attackers.'}
